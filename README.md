# Regression EC with rUnet and ADNI Dataset

## Goal
The objective of this application is to develop machine learning models capable of predicting a complete volumetric brain MRI scan from a future screening round, using data from previous MRI screenings as input..

## Implementation
Our model was inspired by the methodology and source code presented in this paper https://github.com/stfxecutables/Multichannel-input-pixelwise-regression-u-nets and https://openreview.net/forum?id=JG895xlWsfA respectively.


## Model Train
